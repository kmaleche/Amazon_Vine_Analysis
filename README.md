# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the relative authenticity of paid reviews on Amazon and whether the common practice of goods-for-reviews results in positivity bias.

## Results:
  - There were 22 total paid reviews collected through vine, compared to 27,345 unpaid reviews.
  - Of the vine reviews, 59% give a 5-star rating, while 52% of the unpaid reviews had 5-star ratings.

## Summary: 
Though the number of vine reviews in our dataset (22) isn't great enough for us to draw statistically significant conclusions, at a cursory analysis, it appears that paid reviews do tend to inflate product ratings.
